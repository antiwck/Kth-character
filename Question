# Kth-character
Determine the lexicographically smallest string after removing all instances of one type character available in string.

You are given a string S of lowercase alphabets. Now you need to remove all the instances of exactly one type of character such that the new string that is formed is lexicographically smallest across all the other strings that can be formed in a similar way.

For example: Let the string  be "appleap"
1. If you remove all instances of 'a' then the string formed will be : pplep
2. If you remove all isntances of 'p' then the string formed will be : alea
3. If you remove all intsances of 'l' then the string formed will be : appeap
4. If you remove all instances of 'e' then the string formed will be : applap
So among all the newly formed strings , 'alea' is lexicographically smallest string. 

Note : Lexicographically smallest means the string that would appear before all the strings if they were arranged in the order of words appearing in a dictionary.

Input:
First line contains a string  as input

Output:
Print the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed using the process above

Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 10^3 where |S| is the length of string
The string S will contain atleast two distinct characters.

Sample Input:
appleap

Sample Output:
alea
